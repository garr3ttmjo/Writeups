# Belkasoft CTF - March 2021

**Date:** June 25th, 2024

**Author:** Garrett Jones

Challenge created by Belkasoft and can be found at:
 * https://belkasoft.com/ctf_march/

**Concepts:** Sleuthkit (TSK), Windows Disk Forensics, Memory Analysis, Bulk Extractor

## Scenario
You were contacted by a company preparing their new product launch: an AI-based recommendation system that respects target privacy. Just before the date, the source code and technical documents ended up in their competitor's hands. The company suspects a recently hired developer and obtained a copy of his corporate laptop HDD. You are going to analyze the image and support the suspicion with evidence extracted from the laptop...

## Note
I am obviously a little late to this challenge but it has been a good learning experience and I have challenged myself to use the Sleuthkit (TSK) framework from the command line as my main analysis tool.

## Investigation
We are provided SUSPECT.E01 for the disk image to investigate. I am going to convert it to a raw file because I had some issues parsing the E01 format which ends up with a 43 GB SUSPECT.raw image.

For those unfamiliar with The Sleuthkit it was developed by Brian Carrier and is a is a collection of command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze disk images and recover files from them. It is used behind the scenes in Autopsy and many other open source and commercial forensics tools.

I will be working from my Mac so I use the Homebrew package manager to install it with the command 

```brew install sleuthkit```

To start off I am going to use the mmls command to take a look at the partion structure of the disk image.

```
mmls - display the partition layout of a volume system  (partition tables)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mmls SUSPECT.raw 
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000002047   0000002048   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000002048   0001126399   0001124352   NTFS / exFAT (0x07)
003:  000:001   0001126400   0083884031   0082757632   NTFS / exFAT (0x07)
004:  -------   0083884032   0083886079   0000002048   Unallocated
```

Looking at the output there are two NTFS partitions to look at to determine the main volume. To look into further each partion I will use the fls command. To view each partition provide the starting sector offset for each partition.

```
fls - List file and directory names in a disk image.

Viewing the file contents of each partition shows the second one with a starting sector offset of 1126400 is the main volume we will want to be looking at containing user information.

To navigate through the file system you take can use the icat command to output the contents of the file or you can use the fls command to navigate through the directories. To do this you need to provide the inode to the end of the command. This can be found in the second column of the fls output.

## Sleuthkit Examples:
```
Reading contents of autoexec.bat
----------------------------------------
icat -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 21575-128-1
REM Dummy file for NTVDM%
```
```
Extracting $MFT for further analysis
----------------------------------------
icat -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 0-128-6 > MFT.raw
```
```
Checking file type by piping into file command
----------------------------------------
icat -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 21575-128-1 | file -
/dev/stdin: ASCII text, with no line terminators
```
```
Viewing contents of Users directory
----------------------------------------
fls -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 396-144-5

Extract adstresser directory and contents
----------------------------------------
tsk_recover -a -o 1126400 -d 855-144-16 SUSPECT.raw adstresser
Files Recovered: 663
```
## Timelime and MFT
Other setup I am going to do before I start looking into the questions is to create a timeline using Sleuthkit and also parse the MFT using the nfts_dfir python tool.

### Timeline
Setting up a timeline can provided valuable high level insight into a users activity as you can see what files were last created, modified, etc.T he issue is there is a lot of data so you need to find ways to narrow it down.
```
This command recursivly lists everything in a volume and produces a body file with the MACB times for each file so it can read by the mactime tool.

  fls -r -o 1126400 -m / SUSPECT.raw > SUSPECT_body.txt
  
  head SUSPECT_body.txt 
  0|/Documents and Settings ($FILE_NAME)|80328-48-2|d/dr-xr-xr-x|0|0|110|1596318524|1596318524|1596318524|1596318524
  0|/Documents and Settings|80328-144-1|d/dr-xr-xr-x|0|0|48|1596318524|1596318524|1596318524|1596318524
  0|/ProgramData ($FILE_NAME)|237-48-2|d/dr-xr-xr-x|0|0|88|1596321975|1596321975|1596321975|1596321975

The mactime command takes in a body file with -b and then parses the body file and output a timeline to std output. Using -d for delimited we can redirect the output into a csv file to be viewed in Timeline Explorer or Excel.

  mactime -d -b SUSPECT_body.txt > SUSPECT_timeline.csv
  
  head SUSPECT_timeline.csv 
  Date,Size,Type,Mode,UID,GID,Meta,File Name
  Mon Dec 31 1979 23:00:00,173,m...,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,108636-128-1,"/Users/anit.ghosh/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/FileTypePolicies/43/manifest.json"

  Mon Dec 31 1979 23:00:00,1765,m...,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,108663-128-4,"/Users/anit.ghosh/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/SSLErrorAssistant/7/_metadata/verified_contents.json"
```
### MFT
MFT stands for Master File Table and contains records of all of the files within an NTFS volume. Being able to parse this data to find information on the file you are looking for is very valaubleto an investigator.

I gave the example earlier on how to extract the $MFT file with icat (icat -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 0-128-6 > MFT.raw). Now to parse it using the ntfs_parser script from ntfs_dfir. This tool can parse other important ntfs artifacts as well.
```
ntfs_parser -h
Extract information from NTFS metadata files, volumes, and shadow copies

Usage:
 ntfs_parser --mft <input file ($MFT)> <output file (CSV)>
 ntfs_parser --usn <input file ($MFT)> <input file ($UsnJrnl:$J)> <output file (CSV)>
 ntfs_parser --log <input file ($MFT)> <input file ($LogFile)> <output file (TXT)>
 ntfs_parser --indx <input file (raw image)> <volume offset (in bytes)> <output file (CSV)>
 ntfs_parser --all-mft <input file (raw image)> <volume offset (in bytes)> <output file (CSV)>
 ntfs_parser --mem <input file (raw memory image)> <output file (CSV)>
 ntfs_parser --move <input file (tracking.log)> <output file (TXT)>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ntfs_parser --mft MFT.raw MFT_parsed.csv
```
Now we have a file we can view in our favorite csv tool.

## Triage
Its good to start off with a general triage of the disk and contents before diving in to see if anything sticks out.

#### C Directory
* Documents and Settings
      * This points to an older operating system like Windows Vista
* Recycle.Bin
  * Nothing interesting in Recycle Bin
  ```
      fls -r -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 58-144-5

## Questions
1. What is the full name of the laptop owner?
Normally when I want to find out owner I check the version key in the SOFTWARE hive. This shows the RegisteredOwner is User instead of anit.ghosh like I had originally thought. It also shows this is a Windows 10 OS so I was incorrect about this being an older system because of the Documents and Settings folder I saw earlier.

This got me curious about user activity so looking at last logged on user... we can see it is in fact anit.ghosh

```
Next I checked the SAM hive to get information on all system users and was surprised to see User was only active account and anit.ghosh is not mentioned anywhere. 
```
./rip.pl -r ~/Downloads/SUSPECT_Evidence/SAM.raw -p samparse

...

Then I realized from the lastloggedon check that anit.ghosh is a domain user from the PRAIVACYMATRIX domain instead of a local user so it wouldn't appear in the SAM hive. If we want information on user activity the ActiveDirectory database on the domain controller would be our best bet.

That was a little more than necessary but I will say that **Anit Ghosh** is the laptop owner.

2. What is the full address of company's office? Full address line incl. country name
At first I thought maybe looking at some of the documents could reveal this information but couldn't find anything. Then I thought maybe a company website could provide an address. The tool I am going to use is Bulk Extractor which is a useful tool for extracting email address, urls, phone number, and other formatted data from a disk image. 
```
bulk_extractor -o bulk_SUSPECT SUSPECT.raw

First I looked at the domain histogram and nothing stuck out so then I looked at the email_domain_histogram.
```
cat ../bulk_SUSPECT/email_domain_histogram.txt | head
# BANNER FILE NOT PROVIDED (-b option)

```
Here we can see the praivacymatrix.com domain just like we saw earlier with the user logon. If you try to navigate to or search for this website you won't find anything because this challenge is now over 3 years old. But nothing on the Internet ever disapears. Looking up this wesbite up on the Wayback Machine gives us what we are looking for. It shows it was active until February of 2024 so just recently removed. You can find it at https://web.archive.org/web/20220314080131/https://praivacymatrix.com/ and under the Contact Us portion is the company address.

Address: **Ifangstrasse 6, 8952 Schlieren, Zurich, Switzerland**

3. On November 16th security department got a signal of unauthorized attempts to obtain company's trade secrets. When did the suspect first show interest in those? Provide exact timestamp in a common format, e.g. 2021-07-07 17:07:07 UTC

My first idea was to check his browsing activity to see if that could provide any hints. So I extracted anit.ghosh Chrome History db and opened it using sqlite3. Checking the url history provided some suspicous data exfiltration activity below.

select url, title, last_visit_time from urls order by last_visit_time desc;
```
url|title|last_visit_time

```
Here is a summary of what I see
* Writing a bash script to run at a cetain time and send an email which is not guarenteed to be malicious but in this case likely is
* 761263a55b8cfed4bcb8f87cbbb68beaf2ec2423.tar.gz We saw this file earlier in the Downloads folder
* Search for an anonymous file upload
* Figuring out how to securely delete a file
* Extracting a password from a zip file
My guess from this information anit.ghosh attempted to insert a backdoor into some code to send emails later on, then downloads the source code, uploads it to a site, then deletes something with SDelete. I haven't come across a zip file yet but now I will start keeping an eye out.

This leads us to the source code but nothing about the technical documentation. We need to keep looking.

Next I will check his email. If you remember earlier Thunderbird was installed which is a local email client meaning there are likely some emails on the disk. I do a grep search and find a directory I believe should contain the local mail.

Hey John,

I've been requested to review a couple of files. But unfortunately, I could=
n't find the last file in the list - new technical documentation.=20

Could you help me find this file and send it to me? I would be very grateful!

Anit Ghosh.
```
Scrolling through we find evidence of Anit reaching out to people for the technical documentation. Here is the earliest email, sent to John on 05 Nov 2020 14:21:56 -0500.

In the specified format it would be **2021-07-07 17:07:07 UTC**.

4. What 3 employees should be asked questions about unauthorized requests from the suspect? Format: First Last, First Last, First Last

Here we just need to look further into Anit's email files. Sent-1 and INBOX files contain the emails.

Hey Noelle,

I need your help! I accidentally deleted the new technical documentation fro=

ouldn=E2=80=99t do that.

Could you help me get it? Send me a copy please! I will be very happy!

Otherwise I need some kind of help. I forgot to save technical documentatio=

Anit Ghosh.
```
These two emails along with the one from the previous question we can see that Anit reached out to **John Finney**, **Noelle Johnson**, and **Rachel Corbin** about technical documentation.

5. What is the SHA256 hash of the product documentation obtained by the suspect?

I had seen earlier that there was only one document in Anit's directory that had a zone identifier (3 meaning downloaded from the Internet) so that where I looked first. Extracting and looking at the document shows this is confidential documentation for Project X. Anit has other files in his Documents folder with various names pertaining to "technical documentation" but they are for older or irrelevant systems and likely random documents found during the search.

The sha256 hash for the file is **add33ea905399c5063bcc3437cb5c0436a2fd6deb086bb0ec5bf886f72767242**.

6. What employee has actually provided the suspect with the product documentation? Format: First name Last name Employee ID.

When you open and start to look through the pdf documents you will see that someone badly copied this document to send and at the bottom of each page there is a black box redacting whatever information is behind it. This is likely the name of the owner of this document is redacted in an attempt to keep it from being traced back to them. So we need to figure out a way to see whats hidden.

I could not find a way to do this from the command line. I tried pdf2text but was not getting any results because this is not a structured pdf just a hurried, scanned copy. To solve this I used a tool called Master PDF Editor. Then I simply open the pdf, entered document edit mode, and was able to separate the black box from the pdf to see what was behind.

<img width="675" alt="image" src="https://github.com/garr3ttmjo/Writeups/assets/108881417/f4a47270-0f3a-4ffe-b5e1-384be1115808">

Our culprit is **Mark Zukko 381**

7. What URL did the suspect manage to obtain the product source code from? Exact, including file name
If we remember earlier there was a gzip file in the user's Downloads directory that also appeared in their last browser activity being downloaded from git. Looking at the Zone Identifiier for this file give the download url. 
```

8. What e-mail address did the suspect's backdoor code send reports to?
So the user added a backdoor into some code they were working on. If we remember from their browser activity they were researching how to send an email from linux command line so its likely a bash command was added somewhere in their code. The adstresser is the only git repository in the user's directory and we know from the timeline that changes are actively being made to it.

icat is only for extracting individual files so for extracting a directory like adstresser there is a different tool you need to use.

tsk_recover - Export files from an image into a local directory, recovers files to the output_dir from the image.  By default recovers only unallocated files. With flags, it will export all files.

First you need to get the inode for the adstresser directory which is 855-144-16. Then use the tsk_recover command with -a to specify allocated files, -o for the partition offset starting sector, the input image file, and then the output directory
```
fls -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 83898-144-6 | grep adstresser
d/d 855-144-16:	adstresser
```
```
tsk_recover -a -o 1126400 -d 855-144-16 SUSPECT.raw adstresser
Files Recovered: 663
```
```
ls -a adstresser 
.		.git		README.md	gradle		gradlew.bat	src
..		.gitignore	build.gradle	gradlew		settings.gradle
```
Now we have our git repository and we can start searching. The tree command will give you the structure of the directory but nothing sticks out to me. I also try some grep commands to search everything like grep -ri 'bash' * and grep -ri '\@' * but nothing pointing to bash execution or an email address shows up.
```

Since nothing sticks out in the current state of the repository its time to do some git forensics to see if changes were made to other branches of the repo. Starting off we will check the git logs. The most recent commit was to push the HEAD to master so HEAD is what we were looking at earlier. There are like 9 commits here and we can look at each with the git show command.

Date:   Sat Feb 13 00:25:09 2021 +0100

    Added missing escape that lead to service disruptions in case of PEAR errors regarding connecting to database schema files to adjust the copyright file to batch load, and delete the var/test.log file.

Going through each of the logs still doesn't show anything to do with a email backdoor. But if we remember from the timeline HEAD wasn't the only branch being worked on. There was also the wip branch, maybe for work in progress?

9. What is the SHA256 hash of the file exfiltrated?
Looking back at the browsing history we found ealier, the last thing Anit did was google how to create a password protected zip file. If go to that site all the top response are examples on how to do from the command line. On Windows the CMD commands are not stored anywhere but the Powershell ones are. We can find these records in the ConsoleHost_history.txt file and there are two of them on the disk.
```
fls -rp -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw | grep 'ConsoleHost_history.txt'
r/r 100038-128-1:	Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt
r/r 87827-128-4:	Users/anit.ghosh/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt
```
Nothing interesting in the Administrater Powershell history.
```
icat -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 100038-128-1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco install poshgit
nano .\Drivers\etc\hosts
nano .\drivers\etc\hosts
vim
nano

git
bsh
```
Anit's Powershell history would have provided us hints on the adstresser repo activity but we can also see this is how Anit created the 7z to store the source code and upload to the anonymous file share site. The file we are looking for is PHOTOS.7z but Anit sdeleted the tmp folder the file was stored so its unlikely it is on the system. But we can reference the MFT table we parsed at the beginning of this exercise to check.
```

cd ..

```
Looking through the MFT the only reference I can find to possible PHOTOS.7z is a lnk file under Anit's profile.
```
fls -rp -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw | grep 'PHOTOS.lnk'       
r/r 171837-128-1:	Users/anit.ghosh/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Recent/PHOTOS.lnk
```
Extract the lnk file for analysis.
```
icat -o 1126400 SUSPECT.raw 171837-128-1 > PHOTOS.lnk
```
Parse the lnk file with lnkparse and we can see this was a lnk to the PHOTOS.7z but the temp folder was sdeleted meaning it is very unlikely we will recover it off the disk so this is a dead end.
```
lnkparse PHOTOS.lnk

If there is nothing on the disk that can help us the next step would be to look at the memory artifacts. This disk image was acquisitioned soon after all these actions were taken so its possible some information could be stored in memory. Unfortunately we were not provided with the memory image but there is a hyberfil.sys file in the Windows root directory that contains a compressed memory stored to a file when the computer goes into hibernation. We can extract this file and use a tool like Hibernation Recon or Hibr2Bin.exe to decompress this file into binary and then analyze it like we would other memory. I transfered the hiberfil.sys file to a Windows computer so I could use the Hibernation Recon tool on it.

Off to a promising start as I am able to successfully run the windows info plugin on the memory.

The next step is to run strings of the binary and then grep for any mention of PHOTOS.7z. Just like that we find what is likely the uploaded location of the PHOTOS.7z file. Unfortunately anonfiles has since been shutdown and there is not way to recover this file from the site. One of the cons of doing this challenge three years late. I attempted to carve the PHOTOS.7z file from the disk and decompressed binary but 
```
strings ActiveMemory.bin | grep PHOTOS.7z | head

```
10. What is the suspect's cryptocurrency address they intended to get reward paid to?

For this question I need the PHOTOS.7z file which is no longer available and I have't been able to find anywhere else.

11. The suspect left an offshore SIM card in their desk drawer. We suggest it might have been used in exfiltrating the leaked data. Please help us confirm that. What are the 2 phone numbers used in this process: one of the suspect and one of their counterparty? Format: +1234567890, +0987654321.

It makes sense that Anit would send the link to the file to their partner so filtering by the upload link we see this string saying "Here it is: https://anonfiles.com/z3jek3J2p3". If we look at the strings above and below we see this whatsapp link which could be what they used to communicate and could contain their phone numbers.
```

```
The @s.whatsapp.net structure is similar to an email so its likely bulk_extractor would pick it up.
```
bulk_extractor ActiveMemory.bin -o bulk_output
```
In the bulk_extractor email histogram file we can see 8562097771657@c.us and 8562099907377@c.us as two heavily repeating numbers that correspond to our suspects.
```

These numbers are a little long for phone numbers but if you take the last 10 digits off you get 856 country code which corresponds to Laos.
The two numbers are **+8562097771657** and **+8562099907377**.

That completes the challenge. I wish I had been able to complete it the whole way but there was nothing I could do about the PHOTOS.7z file. I'll stay up to date with the future challenges so this isn't an issue. I definitely learned a lot, challenging myself to use the command line as much as possible and learning about tools like bulk_extractor and Hibernation Recon. Hopefully this walkthrough can help other people who are trying to learn how to use The Sleuth Kit framework but just know this only just scratched the surface and there are a lot more tools I didn't touch on.
