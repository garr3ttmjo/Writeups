# Magnet Virtual Summit 2023 CTF - iOS 16 iPhone

**Date:** May 25, 2024

**Author:** Garrett Jones

Challenge provided by Magnet but iOS image can be found at https://cfreds.nist.gov/all/MagnetForensics/MagnetVirtualSummit2023.

Questions can be found at https://cfreds-archive.nist.gov/Hacking_Case.html.

**Concepts:** iLEAPP, Python

# Scenario

The purpose of this walkthrough is to learn about the only open source IOS forensic analysis tool, iLEAP or iOS Logs, Events, and Plist Parser. There are other tools used to analyze mobile devices like Cellebrite, Graykey, or other vendor tools but these are very expensive so they are out of reach for the average individual. 

This challenge was created by Magnet as part of their 2023 Virtual Summit.

# iLEAPP Setup

Clone the codebase using this command

```git clone https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP.git```

Then change to the directory and download the dependencies

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Start iLEAPP by executing the ileapGUI.py script

```python3 ileappGUI.py```

Using the GUI select the location of the source image and output locations.

Then open one of the html pages and it will open up the report in the browser for viewing. On the left there is the column containing all of the parsed artifacts for review.

|Data|Source|
|:----|:----|
|blueisth3best@icloud.com|Apple Mail, Discord Account|
|blue15awsome|Discord Message|

#### 4. What Chinese networking website was associated with Linkedin?

iLEAPP does't have a parser for LinkedIn so this will need to be done more manually.

I used this tool to parse the Application GUIs to names so I could figure out which contained LinkedIn. Just point the script at your IOS input and it will output a csv containing a list of the the Applications on the device.

https://github.com/controlf/iOSGUIDNameResolver/blob/main/ios_app_guid_resolver.py

```
usage: ios_app_guid_resolver.py [-h] -i I -a A -o O

iOS Application GUID Name Resolver

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -i I        The iOS input archive (Full File System)
  -a A        Accepts: 'all' (all apps) or '3rd' (third party apps only)
  -o O        Output format: accepts 'df' or 'csv'
```

The LinkedIn app can be found at private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/4D867879-C7BD-4906-8865-EAE0AA4E6236/LinkedIn.app/LinkedIn

We are looking for a url so I am going to do a string search for http to see what comes up.

```strings LinkedIn | grep -I "http" | less```

Scanning through the output there are 3 urls that stick out. I can use a tool like check-host.net to lookup these URLs to get info.

<img width="903" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deac642e-8205-404c-8c6d-ccc25c29c7d0">

http://wechat.com -- China

http://user.qzone.qq.com/ -- China

https://icq.com/people/ -- Russian

I coudn't find a direct correlation between LinkedIn and wechat or qzone but it is one of them.

Summaries from Wikipedia

QZONE - Qzone (simplified Chinese: QQ空间; traditional Chinese: QQ空間; pinyin: QQ Kōngjīan) is a social networking website based in China which was created by Tencent in 2005. It allows users to write blogs, keep diaries, send photos, listen to music, and watch videos. Users can set their Qzone background and select accessories based on their preferences so that every Qzone is customized to the individual member's taste. However, most Qzone accessories are not free; only after buying the "Canary Yellow Diamond" can users access every service without paying extra.

WECHAT - WeChat or Weixin in Chinese (Chinese: 微信; pinyin: Wēixìn (listenⓘ); lit. 'micro-message') is a Chinese instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment app developed by Tencent. First released in 2011, it became the world's largest standalone mobile app in 2018 with over 1 billion monthly active users.WeChat has been described as China's "app for everything" and a super-app because of its wide range of functions. WeChat provides text messaging, hold-to-talk voice messaging, broadcast (one-to-many) messaging, video conferencing, video games, mobile payment, sharing of photographs and videos and location sharing.!

#### 5. At which market was the user viewing Chef Pasquale tomato sauce?

Go through the Photo.sqlite artifact until you find the picture of tomato sauce. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae594afe-aabf-43a2-810f-117f07b98272)

Note the file name and then run use exiftool to view the metadata

```
exiftool private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/IMG_0034.HEIC

#### 6. What color shirt did the user choose to put their snapchat bitmoji in?

iLEAPP does not have a snapchat parser but we can use https://github.com/DFIR-HBG/Snapchat_Auto instead. It provides a nice GUI that you can point at your extraction.

<img width="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27b72aff-7c36-48f9-8f2a-842b9c5519e4">

This will provide information like Michael's username.

<img width="748" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c1ccf2b-656d-4ae7-957e-28730288cc5a">

Which can then be looked up at https://www.snapchat.com/add/m_b227468 to view his bitmoji.

<img width="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/110db340-6475-42ba-a50c-f1f616e5ce25">

#### 7. What server was the user interested in making?

Look in the Discord Messages and Chrome History reports.

Discord

|Timestamp|Username|Content|

#### 8. What Sports stadium was the user overlooking at Camilien-Houde belvedere?

Scroll through the photos and there is a grouping that seems to be from an outlook looking over the city with maybe a stadium in the background.

For example private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/IMG_0032.HEIC.

<img width="697" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5710860-9f52-4031-8b50-eb3d5ed2792a">

Extract the metadata with exiftool and then use the coordinates to get the locations. It laces him in Mount Royal Park right outside Belvédère Camillien-Houde. To the east of this location we can see the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium is within eye distance.

<img width="878" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10d97596-066d-44a1-ae33-ac9b50147ec0">

#### 9. What light-hearted game did the user spend the most time on?
Application usage is not something iLEAPP parses either so back to manual.

Cellebrite is an industry expert on mobile forensics and here is an article they put out talking about app usage from screen time tracking.

https://cellebrite.com/en/a-look-into-apples-screen-time-feature-and-what-insights-it-lends-to-digital-intelligence/

We can query the RMAdminStore-Local.sqlite db found at private/var/mobile/Library/Application Support/com.apple.remotemanagementd. 

The table contains the data we are looking for so we can do something like

```
select distinct ZBUNDLEIDENTIFIER, ZTOTALTIMEINSECONDS from ZUSAGETIMEDITEM order by ZTOTALTIMEINSECONDS desc;

ZBUNDLEIDENTIFIER|ZTOTALTIMEINSECONDS
com.apple.Maps|3600
com.apple.Maps|875
com.apple.AppStore|849
com.apple.AppStore|762
com.hammerandchisel.discord|707
com.midasplayer.apps.candycrushsaga|577
com.google.ios.youtube|562
com.apple.weather|513
com.apple.Maps|454
com.google.photos|424
com.apple.camera|423
com.yikyak.2|399
com.apple.camera|385
com.reddit.Reddit|368
com.google.chrome.ios|354
com.google.Gmail|353
com.google.chrome.ios|353
```
If we go down the list we see the 6th highest application is candy crush at around 10 minutes of usage. You can also look in the Biome AppInFocus report from iLEAPP and search "candy crush" to find it was in focus between 2022-12-23 16:43:19 and 2022-12-23 16:52:56, for about 8 minutes.

#### 10. Which airline lounge was viewed?

The only reference to a lounge I could find was in the Biome User Activity Metadata report from an Apple Maps search for "Lufthansa Senator Lounge in Newark".

<img width="1346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2a587e6-80fb-437a-96a1-8b2030b0fed9">

#### 11. Which terms and conditions site on Tik Tok is named after a space formation?

At first I looked in the TikTok app location at private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/DADABF7F-CAA3-4724-8CA4-A1C0434774E8/TikTok.app but after a lot of searching found no results. One thing I thought was weird was that there were no sqlite db for storing any settings or data. I did some research and found there was another locations but associated with bytedance the parent company. The GUID parser I was using had this under musically so I missed it but the location is /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/4F9E5274-DDB7-422E-8629-234C84D24F4E. 

I run the below command in the directory trying to find an database related to terms and conditions.

```
find . -type f -name "*.sqlite" -exec grep -H "terms" {} \;        
Binary file ./Library/AWEStorage/UnifyStorage.sqlite matches
```
Then I focus on this UnifyStorage.sqlite file. I use strings and look for mention of the words terms, conditions, and then finally legal and I get a match.
```
strings Library/AWEStorage/UnifyStorage.sqlite | grep legal | less

Ghttps://www.tiktok.com/falcon/forest/nebula/common_legal?hide_nav_bar=1_
4https://www.tiktok.com/falcon/forest/nebula/ad_legal
```

This url has a nebula directory which is the mentioned space formation.

#### 12. Which cardinal direction was the user turning when driving towards RHEINFAHRE?

Doing an Apple Maps search for RHEINFARHE shows it is a location in Germany.

Location
-------------
Rheinfähre
67583 Guntersblum
Rhineland-Palatinate
Germany
Coordinates
-------------
49.80799° N, 8.39196° E

I wrote a python script to extract geolocation data from artifacts like photos and the ZRTCLLOCATIONMO so I could have them mapped out for better visualization. The Rhine River is in Germany so we can narrow it down to the photos in Germany.

<img width="1179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4678e30-adff-493e-8670-a6d2caa81f65">

Going through the images there is one photo with a sign directing towards RHEINFARHE or Rhine Ferry.

<img width="671" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0204847-f46b-4e40-8496-274eee9336e0">

Putting the coordinates from the picture in maps shows they are likely heading down WEINHEIMER STRABE towards Oestrich-Winkel and the river. This would make their direction South with maybe a little East.

<img width="372" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f57b0fb-1748-4a47-9394-9b2b90c53fbd">

#### 13. The user was trying to learn German through an application, what promotion featuring a rocket was most commonly shown to the user?

Searching through the applications I find that Duolingo is installed. So to search for Duolingo related files
```
find . -iname "*duolingo*"
```
Promotion makes me think of advertisment or comerical and in the output of this search I see some .mp4 files so I am going to filter for those.

```
find . -iname "*duolingo*" | grep .mp4

./private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/89A6AE48-C46D-4405-A187-C7FF439873F3/Documents/plus-ad-video/Duolingo_NYPromo_2023_EN.mp4
./private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/89A6AE48-C46D-4405-A187-C7FF439873F3/Documents/plus-ad-video/Duolingo_FamilyPlan_Super_EN_2.mp4
./private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/89A6AE48-C46D-4405-A187-C7FF439873F3/Documents/plus-ad-video/Duolingo_NYPromo_2023_VO_EN.mp4
```
Open the first .mp4 file for the NYPromo and it is the Duolingo bird on a rocket and its a promo for Super Duolingo for the New Year.

#### 14. At which location did the user travel the most meters according to Apple? (City, Country)

#### 15. What weather front was warned to the user by youtube?
